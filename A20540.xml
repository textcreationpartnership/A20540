            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL MAI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Eraſmus Dryden Eſquier, grace, and peace be multiplied.</head>
            <p>SIR, it is a point well knowne vnto your Worſhip, that in duties of abſolute neceſſity we muſt regard what God doth commande and enioyne, not what men doe approue and like of: and that we muſt ſtill offer vp our ſeruice in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Almighty, whatſoeuer men do thinke or ſpeake of vs. As for this worke of publiſhing the labours of ſuch faithfull and painefull Miniſters, as deſire rather to ſpend their time in preaching, than in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, I take it not to be a duty of that kind:
<pb facs="tcp:18031:3"/> but of an inferiour nature; wherein the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance or diſallowance of thoſe that are godly wiſe, ſhould haue a great ſtroke, either for incouragement to proceed in it, or for diſcouragement to deſiſt from it Herein ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing made ſome tryal, I haue (through Gods bleſſing) found ſucceſſe beyond my expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: which as it miniſtreth vnto me mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of much reioycing, in regard there are many thouſands in Iſrael, who deſire and embrace the ſincere and plaine doctrine of the Goſpell; ſo doth it ſet an edge on my deſires to take vp ſome vacant houres in this imployment: being right glad, if by any meanes I may be an helper to the truth, and an inſtrument of refreſhing hunger-bitten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoules, by conueying vnto them ſome baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets full of ſuch fragments, as may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated without any detriment or diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage to my ſelfe, or to any elſe. Theſe Sermons I haue made bolde to recommend vnto your fauourable acceptance and patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, not onely in regard of the intereſt which you haue in them, and that incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which I haue often receiued from your
<pb facs="tcp:18031:3"/> Worſhip in buſineſſes of this nature; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo becauſe I perſwade my ſelfe that your ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry countenancing of them, wil adde, though not vnto their goodneſſe, yet vnto their good eſteeme, among many that are religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly affected.</p>
            <p>I haue annexed vnto theſe Sermons, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſelect points of doctrine, without any ſpeciall texts of Scripture prefixed thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: and that becauſe I found the reſt of the doctrines that were deliuered with thoſe, either very briefly handled, and ſo vnfit to be printed, or elſe treated of in ſome of the Sermons already extant. And thus nothing doubting of your Worſhips fauour in taking in good worth this my bold attempt, I leaue you to the ſafe tuition of God almighty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching him to enrich you and yours with all manner of corporall and ſpirituall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings in Chriſt Ieſus; and to adde vnto your life, as alſo vnto the life of your faithfull and gracious yoake-fellow, many happy and comfortable daies.</p>

            <p>IN the eight &amp; ninth verſes of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is ſet downe a gracious promiſe of God, made vnto the church, which ſhould
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:18031:6"/> be in the time of the Goſpell (for that is meant by the inhabitants of <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi>) Which promiſe is this, that he that is feeble among them: that is, the weakeſt Chriſtian that made conſcience of the meanes of his ſaluation, in that day ſhould be as <hi>Dauid:</hi> that is, equall to the moſt excellent in the time of the law in ſundry reſpects: and the houſe of <hi>Dauid:</hi> that is, the excellenter ſort of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, ſhould be as Gods houſe, and as the Angell of the Lord before them. The Prophet could not find any holy man, with whom he might fitly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them, and therefore he ſaith, that they ſhould be like the Angell of the couenant Chriſt Ieſus, which went before the Iſraelites in the wilderneſſe to guide and gouerne them.</p>
            <p>Then hee goeth on and telleth vs, that after the Lord hath ſhewed this mercy vnto his Church, <hi>He will ſeeke to destroy all nations that come againſt</hi> Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem; that is, all the enimies that doe oppoſe themſelues vnto his people, and endeauour to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his good worke in them, and for them. Now when it is ſaid that <hi>he will ſeeke to destroy them,</hi> the meaning is, that as he hath a reſolution to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw them, ſo he will prouide meanes whereby it ſhall be effected.</p>
            <p>Then further in the tenth verſe he ſetteth downe the meanes how his people ſhould bee brought to ſuch excellencie. <hi>I wil powre vpon the houſe of</hi> Dauid, <hi>and vpon the inhabitants of</hi> Ieruſalem, <hi>the Spirit of grace, &amp;c.</hi> Signifying that he would vouchſafe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Church vnder the Goſpell a more plentifull
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:18031:6"/> meaſure of his Spirit, that as they ſhould haue more excellent, and cleere, and powerfull meanes; ſo they ſhould finde a greater bleſſing vpon the vſe of thoſe meanes: that whereas vnder the law, they had but drops of grace, diſtilling eaſily &amp; by little and little, now they ſhould haue whole buckets full, as it were; yea whole flouds of grace powred downe vpon all ſorts of Gods ſeruantes. By the <hi>Spirit of grace,</hi> is meant the Spirit of adoption, and of regeneration; ſo called, both becauſe it is giuen out of Gods free grace and fauour, as alſo becauſe it worketh grace and goodneſſe in all ſuch as are endued therewith: this Spirit is further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by a ſpeciall effect, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is a Spirit <hi>of prayers.</hi> Till ſuch time as men are made partakers hereof, they may vſe many words of prayer, but they are altogether idle and vaine; fruites of their fleſh, and not of their faith; ſuch as they haue great cauſe to be humbled for, and no reaſon at all to be comforted in: but when once they haue this Spirit put into their hearts, they can call vppon the Lord in an acceptable and comfortable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>Then next is ſhewed whither this Spirit leadeth them; to wit, vnto Chriſt. <hi>They ſhall looke on him, whom they haue pierced.</hi> When men begin to pray in a religious and conſcionable manner, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime all fleſhly helps and hopes, and betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto their Sauiour, whom they haue pierced by their ſinnes: for it cannot properly bee ſaide, that the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſes,</hi> or <hi>Iudas,</hi> or the high
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:18031:7"/> Prieſts, or the <hi>Romanes,</hi> did put Chriſt to death, they being but inſtruments thereof; but the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities of Gods elect did the fact, and they were indeed the true and principall cauſe, that brought vpon the Sonne of God all manner of affliction, and perſecution, and execution it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>In the next place it is ſaid, that when his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhall looke vpon him, <hi>They ſhall lament for him, or ouer him, or concerning him:</hi> (all comes to one rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning.) As ſoone as they ſee what euils, and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, they haue brought vpon Chriſt Ieſus, by their tranſgreſſions, and how odious their offences are, which could be healed by no other medicine, but by the precious bloud of the immaculate lambe of God: the due conſideration hereof will cauſe them to bee troubled and grieued at the very heart. Which griefe is ſet out, by two ſpeciall circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; two wit, by the greatneſſe of it, and by the truth of it. The greatneſſe thereof is declared by two compariſons, which yet are inferiour and leſſe then the thing it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>For the firſt compariſon, it is ſaid, <hi>That they ſhould lament for him, as one that mourneth for his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſonne, and be ſorry, as one is ſorry for his first borne.</hi> If parents haue many children, yet it will much grieue them to part with any of them: but if they haue but one onely ſonne, who is likely to be the heire of the family, and they loſe him, and ſo are diſappointed of their hope, then they vſually mourne with an exceeding bitter lamentation, as the woman of the cittie of <hi>Nain</hi> did for the death
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18031:7"/> of her onely ſon. <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 11. Such (the holy Ghoſt ſaith) ſhall be the ſorrow of all true penitent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, when they apprehend the multitude and grieuouſneſſe of their ſinnes, whereby they haue ſlaine the Lord of life.</p>
            <p>The ſecond compariſon, here vſed to expreſſe the meaſure of their ſorrow, is taken from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> who when their godly and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy king <hi>Ioſiah</hi> was ſlaine in the valley of <hi>Megid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> neere <hi>Hadadrimmon,</hi> in fighting againſt <hi>Pharoah Necho,</hi> king of <hi>Aegipt,</hi> they lamented for him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<note place="margin">2. Chron. 35.</note> bitterly: and not onely the common people who haue not ſo good a gouernement of their affections, mourned for him, but <hi>Ieremiah</hi> the Prophet alſo, and others of the beſt ſort of men and women, tooke this loſſe exceedingly to heart, as ſeeing in the death of <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> the death and ruine both of Church and common wealth. In which regard it was ſet downe as an ordinance, that they ſhould haue ſet times of mourning, for that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction which befell them through his death; and ſuch (ſaith the Prophet) ſhall bee the lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe that attaine to the ſight and ſence of their ſinnes, whereby they haue ſlaine the Lord Chriſt Ieſus. verſe 11.</p>
            <p>Hauing thus ſet forth the greatneſſe of their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, he commeth in the next place to expreſſe the ſoundneſſe thereof: <hi>The land ſhall bewaile euery fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily apart, &amp;c.</hi> Not in the publicke aſſemblies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, where the teares of one may draw on the teares of another, and ſo their mourning be either
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18031:8"/> naturall for company, or hypocriticall for vaine glory: but he ſaith, that euery family ſhould weepe apart, and in priuate; yea not onely the ſeuerall families, but particular perſons, yea thoſe that were moſt neerely lincked together, <hi>viz.</hi> the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and the wife, ſhould bee ſeparated in this worke of humiliation, and not content themſelues to pray and bewaile their ſinnes one with another, but take ſome time each of them to performe this dutie in ſecret; and if they that are ſo inward one with another ſhould lament apart, much more others, that are further off one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>By the houſe of <hi>Dauid</hi> is meant (as was before ſhewed) the excellenter ſort of Chriſtians; and the like is ſignified by the houſe of <hi>Nathan,</hi> who was the ſon of <hi>Dauid,</hi> of whom Chriſt came: (for the family of <hi>Salomon</hi> was wholy extinguiſhed.) By the houſe of <hi>Leui,</hi> is meant the ordinary ſort of the <hi>Leuites;</hi> and as for the family of <hi>Shimei,</hi> it was one of the principall families of <hi>Leui.</hi> Whence we may obſerue, that all families without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are tyed to this worke, and ought iointly and ſeuerally to performe the ſame. None are ſo good but they muſt weepe for their ſinnes in ſecret, and pray for the continuance &amp; increaſe of their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: and as it is not needleſſe for the beſt, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it bootleſſe for the meaneſt, but whoſoeuer doth ſo, ſhall haue a fountaine of grace opened vnto him, whereby all his iniquities ſhall be waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away.</p>

            <p>The drift then of theſe words (we ſee) is, to manifeſt and expreſſe the great goodneſſe of God towards his ſeruants, in the time of the Goſpel; and here is ſhewed,

            <p>And as there is a conflict in the vnderſtanding
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:18031:13"/> part, ſo is there the like in the affections: for the fleſh is ready to draw them vnto pride &amp; enuy, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannes, and couetouſnes, &amp;c. But the Spirit ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth &amp; moueth them vnto better things, ſhewing withall that thoſe forenamed vices will harden the heart, make it vnfit for prayer, or thankeſgiuing, or any ſuch ſpirituall exerciſe; and in the end will bring manie bitter troubles and afflictions vpon thoſe that let them to haue ſway and dominion in their ſoules: all which euil inconueniences we ſhall eſcape if our affections be heauenly and ſpirituall, and ſet on their right obiects.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe in the will this fight will appeare, whereſoeuer true ſanctification is begun. For the fleſh wil be vnwilling to pray, to heare, to meditate, to conferre; and in a word, as any duty tendeth more to the crucifying of the luſts thereof, ſo will it be more auerſe therefrom, and more prone to delay and to put off the performance thereof. But the regenerate part is contrarily diſpoſed, and chearefully embraceth that which is good, though it be clogged and hindered in the performance of the ſame: ſetting down this for a certaine truth, that the more painfull any ſeruice is, the more gainfull it is; that though we begin our prayers in heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, yet we may end in gladneſſe; that the more vntractable and vntoward the fleſh is, the more glorious our conqueſt is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if we can get the maiſtery of it, and bring it into Gods preſence; and that if we cannot do as well as we would, yet if we do as well as we can, we ſhall be accepted and bleſſed of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:18031:14"/> the Lord: and by the ſight and ſenſe of our mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold failings, grow more humble and lowly in our owne eyes, and more pittifull and gentle towards others.</p>
            <p>And laſtly for the memory, before their conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Gods owne children are prone to remember iniuries and vnkindnes which others haue offered vnto them, and to forget ſuch as they haue offered vnto others; they can hold faſt all ſuch things as will further corrupt them, but they let ſlip whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer may benefite and helpe them in good and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly courſes: but after their regeneration the caſe is altered with them: for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſtriue to diſburden their memories of all things that may hurt them, and to retaine onely ſuch matters as may make them more humble, and mercifull, and thankfull. This ſpirituall fight in the inward man is a moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible marke of the ſpirit of grace, which is the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to bee noted, becauſe many of Gods ſeruants through ignorance take it to be quite contrary. We finde (ſay they) ſuch a deale of carnall reaſon, ſo many ſinfull affections and luſts, and ſuch vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe and vnfitneſſe for euery holy duty, that we much doubt whether we haue Gods ſpirit in vs or not. But who tels you that there are ſo many things amiſſe in you? who is it that cauſeth you to ſee the errours of your minde, and the corruptions of your heart? who is it that cauſeth you to hate them, and to be out of liking with your ſelfe for them? who is it that enableth you to take Gods part againſt them, and to ſtriue by all meanes to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:18031:14"/> be freed from the bondage of them? Is it not the ſpirit of God that worketh all theſe good things in you? and why then ſhould you make queſtion whether it dwell in you yea or no? theſe are fruits of the Spirit, which are neuer found in any but in ſpirituall men.</p>
            <p>And if any deſire yet a further triall, let him exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whether there bee in him thoſe other vertues of the Spirit which are recited <hi>Gal. 5. 22. viz.</hi> 1.

            <p>Firſt we muſt haue a warrant for the things<note place="margin">Rules for prayer. 1</note> that we aske, and that from the word of God,

That is, as it were, the wood, whence we muſt fetch timber for this building: and the mine out of which we may take many golden arguments to bring before the Lord in our prayers, which he cannot deny becauſe they are his owne hand writing, whereby he doth graunt vs liberty to aske, and aſſurance to obtaine all need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full things.

Such fleſhly petitions may we ſometimes put vp before the Lord; but we ſhall haue checks and rebukes in our hearts for the ſame, and no aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that they ſhall be granted: but when our ſuits are ſpirituall, the holy Ghoſt which moueth vs to aske, will alſo perſwade vs that God is able and willing to heare vs, and to relieue vs, and that therefore we ſhall obtaine a bleſſing ſooner or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

               <hi>wauereth,</hi> and maketh queſtion whether God will heare him or not, <hi>is like a waue of the ſea tost with the winde, and caried away;</hi> being neuer at quiet in himſelfe, but ſometimes imagining that the Lord will helpe him, he runneth vnto him; and then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a conceipt that ſuch and ſuch men will doe ſomewhat for him, he leaueth prayer, and beta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth himſelfe vnto them: but finding no reliefe there, he will to prayer againe; and yet hauing not a preſent anſwer, nor faith to waite vpon the Lord, he fals to ſhift for himſelfe by vſing of ill meanes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo is altogether vnſtable and vnſetled, euen as the waues of the ſea that are neuer at reſt; euery vaine cogitation, &amp; euery ſlight temptation toſſing and turmoyling, and diſquieting his heart. Thus it ought not to be, neither will it be thus with thoſe

Men will be glad to be rid of importunate ſuiters, that they ſhould not bee ſtill hanging vpon them, eſpecially if their ſuite bee weighty, and the things that they craue of ſome importance: but the Lord would in no caſe haue men to let their ſuits fall; nay he takes delight in ſuch as will not haue a repulſe, but ſtill depend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and daily renew their petitions: for they ſhew euidently that they haue a liuely and ſtrong faith: they would not preſume to aske vnleſſe they had a warrant; and hauing a warrant, they dare not make queſtion of obtaining; for that were to make doubt of Gods truth and fidelity.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee what it is to <hi>pray in the holy Ghoſt, viz.</hi> to haue a good ground for that which we aske: a good end, and a good affection in asking, and faith to beleeue that we ſhall obtaine whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer we aske in ſuch a maner.</p>

Queſtionleſſe if we haue any ſpirituall life and ſenſe in vs, this will make vs loath our ſinnes, that brought our deare Sauiour ſo much woe and miſery; and cauſe vs heartily to mourne for the ſame, euen as a man would doe at the ſight of a knife, or ſword, or ſome ſuch like inſtrument, whereby at vnawares he hath ſlaine his child, or wife, or any that was neare and deare vnto him.

Such kind of perſons may aſſure themſelues, that their hearts are not right with God, and that they are not ledde by the Spirit of grace, which drawes thoſe in whom it reigneth, vnto the performance of good duties apart, as well as with company: in their cloſets, in their chambers, in the fields, or in ſome ſuch priuate places or other, as well as in the Church, or with the whole ſociety where they liue.</p>

            <p>IN the words immediatly going before, is declared, how Chriſt rebuked thoſe that would call him, Lord, Lord, and make a profeſſion of religion, and yet not doe the things that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:18031:34"/> them: for if they woulde ſpeake to their Lords, they muſt ſpeake to their luſts, for to them they are in ſubiection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hauing beſtowed ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe vpon them, hee leaueth them not ſo, but directeth them what they ſhould doe, exhorting them to a conſcionable practiſe of the word, to the which that he might more throughly perſwade them, he vſeth two forcible reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1 One is taken from the great commodity that will redound vnto thoſe that doe practiſe it, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they ſhall be inuincible againſt all tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and vnmoueable in all the ſtormes and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts that ſhall ariſe.

            <p n="2">2 Another is taken from the great danger that will enſue vpon the contrary; which is this; that let men heare as much as they will, if they do not yeeld obedience vnto it, they ſhall haue a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and fearfull, and vnrecouerable fall: and therefore are they compared to an houſe that hath good ſtone and timber and workemanſhip beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about it, but it is built on an ill foundation, on the ſand, or on a quagmire, which is ſhaken by euery blaſt of winde, and if their ariſe any bluſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſtormes, is vtterly ouerthrowne.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> Verſ. 47 [<hi>VVhoſoeuer commeth to me</hi>] In that Chriſt ſheweth that ſome haue recourſe vnto him, to heare his word, and are builders as well as others, <note place="margin">Hypocrits in many things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with Chriſtians.</note> (48) and yet are but diſſemblers, which appeareth by their end; the doctrine hence to be learned is, that hypocrites may goe as farre as Chriſtians in many things.</p>
            <pb n="59" facs="tcp:18031:34"/>
            <p>They may come to Chriſt in the hearing of the word, in the receiuing of the Sacrament, in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke prayer, and yet be falſe-hearted all the while. A true Chriſtian heares the pure word of God, without mixture of popiſh or humane inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſo doth an hypocrite. A true Chriſtian is a builder, he edifies himſelfe in knowledge and vnderſtanding; ſo doth an hypocrite. <hi>Iudas</hi> as well as <hi>Peter</hi> can carry away many good leſſons; and yet the one goe to hell for his falſhoode and guile, when the other hath heauen for his porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: becauſe he had an vpright heart, and a ſpirit without guile. Thus farre we ſee in the text where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in true Chriſtians, and hypocrites do agreee: now let vs conſider what difference there is betwixt them. The one when he is to build, digges deepe, and caſts out the looſe earth, that ſo his founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be firme and ſure: implying thus much, that the ſeruants of God know their hearts to be hollow and falſe ground, and therefore when they haue heard a Sermon, they ſuſpect their owne guiltineſſe, and ſo ſearch their hearts and lament their corruptions: for ſearching is digging, and lamenting is caſting foorth of the rubbiſh and looſe earth. They thinke their labour euen loſt, vnleſſe their hearts can meete with ſuch a promiſe, with ſuch a threatening, or with ſuch an inſtruction, to make a right vſe of the ſame.</p>
            <p>Now on the other ſide, an hypocrite makes quicke worke, all his building is aboue ground,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:18031:35"/> and therefore when he hath talked a little of the Sermon, he is well, and thinkes all his worke is diſpatched: he ſpends no time in digging and ſearching; nor in grieuing and lamenting for his corruptions: nay he cenſureth Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans as too melancholy and penſiue, that will goe aſide into a corner, and there deale by prayers and teares betwixt God and their owne hearts: what neede all this adoe (ſaith the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite) is not God mercifull? He is ſo indeed, yet will he haue vs to be ſeuere and vnmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full towards our corrupt and euill luſtes, and therefore ſtill to be digging at them, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of them foorth of our hearts. And as in this place wee may perceiue how farre true Chriſtians doe both agree and differ, ſo there are other Scriptures to cleare the ſame, as the eight of <hi>Luke,</hi> the parable of the grounds, wherein it is euident, that the ſtonie ground did heare the word of God, and that with vnderſtanding, yea with ioy: nay which is more, the thorny ground did not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the ſeede, but brought foorth both the blade and the eare, that is, did not onely with readineſſe receiue the word, but alſo did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what (in their manner) which the word com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded: thus farre the ill grounds agreed with the good ground. But herein the good ground went beyond them, that thoſe that were ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereby, came with a good and honeſt heart, and had patience to vndergoe perſecution for the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:18031:35"/> truth, and contempt of the world, that they would not bee choaked with the cares and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures thereof: whereas the other ſort if they ſaw in likelyhood, that they might get more profite and eaſe by following the world, then by embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Chriſt, they were gone.</p>
            <p>Another place fit for the proofe of this poynt, wee haue in the parable of the Virgins; where<note place="margin">Matth. 25.</note> we may obſerue. 1. That they were all [Virgins] that is, ſuch as did profeſſe to ſeparate themſelues from worldly luſts, and did not go a whoring after the common corruptions of the times, but kept themſelues within the bounds of outward ſobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; as <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> for a time did, who could not be charged with groſſe couetouſneſſe or coſenage, or the like. 2. Further they had all [lampes] that is, an outward ſhew of good things. And (3.) [Oyle in their lampes] ſo much as could make a blaze to get them the credit of profeſſors: they could ſpeake well, and do diuers works that were glorious in the view of the world. 4. They all went to meete the Bride-groome] that is, all of them frequented the meanes of ſaluation, as if they expected fauour and fellowſhip with Chriſt Ieſus. 5. Laſtly (it is ſaid) they all [ſlumbred and ſlept] that is, thoſe that were true Chriſtians, hauing ſound fruits of pietie and ſinceritie in their hearts, and in their liues, knew their eſtate was good, and therefore waited for their Sauiour with quiet and peaceable hearts. Hypocrites alſo, ſeeing that they went beyond Atheiſts and prophane perſons,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:18031:36"/> thought their caſe was good, and thereupon they grew ſecure, and neuer troubled themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the aſſurance of their election: Thus farre the wiſe and fooliſh virgins accord. But here is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that the fooliſh Virgins haue no more oyle than they carry in their lamps: the world may eaſily ſee all that is in them: but the wiſe Virgins haue a lampe to carry oyle, and an heart to carry oyle: they haue two veſſels, one for practiſe, and another for ſtore; that though the oyle in the lampe ſhould bee ſpent, yet there might bee a new ſupply made.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> Thus we ſee in how many things falſe-hearted diſſemblers come neare the ſincereſt of Gods ſeruants. Which ſerueth, firſt for the reproofe of them, that becauſe they liue a ciuill life, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the word and the ſacraments, thinke they haue gone farre enough, and account themſelues very good Chrrſtians: this is but to be a builder, one of the ill grounds, one of the fiue fooliſh Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, and therefore as yet their caſe is wofull.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, if thoſe that goe ſo farre, be notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding miſerable, then how curſed are they that haue not proceeded ſo farre? that are not builders, but deſtroyers of themſelues and others by their corrupt ſpeeches, and by their lewd example and courſe of life? that are not arable grounds, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together a wilde waſte? that are not Virgins, but doe ſtill commit ſpirituall whoredome (and that in the ſight of all the world) againſt the Lord God of heauen, that is a iealous God? If their fall ſhall
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:18031:36"/> be horrible and fearefull that build, and that with the good word of God; becauſe they build on an ill foundation: how terrible muſt their iudgement needs be, that come ſo farre behinde ſuch in any ſhew of goodneſſe, and go ſo farre beyond them in euery kinde of groſſe wickedneſſe? If theſe grounds that made ſhew of fruitfulneſſe be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed, becauſe they bring not forth ripe fruit, then what ſhall become of them that will not endure any plowing at all, but bring forth bryars and brambles, and all manner of poyſoned weeds? And if it went ſo hard with thoſe that were Virgins, and went with their lampes to meet the bride-groome, then what muſt their doome be that are not Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, but adulterers, and adultereſſes? that loue the earth more then heauen, and earthly things more then heauenly things? that would rather be at a table of good cheare where their bodies may be pampered, then at the Lords table, where their ſoules might be fedde vnto eternall life? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly theſe mens iudgements ſleepeth not, and when it ouertaketh them, woe vnto them; for their caſe wil be moſt lamentable. Neither need they cry out againſt hypocrites, for they are ten times worſe then hypocrites, and their puniſhment muſt be ſutable.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, this is for inſtruction, that ſith hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites ſeeme to draw in the ſame yoake of ſincerity with the Saints of God, therefore we ſhould ſearch our hearts and our thoughts, and not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly build aboue ground, but looke whether our

               <note place="margin">Ier. 17.</note> 
               <hi>all things,</hi> yet the word of God tryeth it: that ſetteth it, as it were, vpon the racke, and is as a two-edged ſword that diuideth betweene the heart and the reines, and findeth out all ſhifts and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes whatſoeuer. But that we may more plainely perceiue the way how to get a ſincere heart, let vs obſerue theſe directions following.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt ſhall be taken out of the text, namely,<note place="margin">How to get &amp; try an vpright heart.</note> that we muſt digge and ſearch into our conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and when we finde any corruption therein, we muſt caſt it forth. It is not ſufficient to ſay, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede I finde an ill foundation, but there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, I muſt builde vpon it: nay a good builder will not do ſo, but throw out euery thing that might endanger his foundation. And ſo ſhould we deale with ſinne, and thereby may we try our plainneſſe, if we can ſoundly iudge our ſelues, and be glad to be admoniſhed of others, it is a ſigne that there is vprightneſſe in vs: as it is an euident token that he mindes to haue a good foundation, that when his neighbour comes with a ſpade, and tels him, I ſee you haue much adoe here, and that you neede helpe, I will ioyne with you, is glad of this newes, and thankfully accepts of him and of his labour.</p>
            <p>This is contrary vnto the Scribes and Phariſes practize, who had little to ſay againſt the gifts of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> and of Chriſt; but when they came to digge at their pride, and couetouſneſſe, and cruelty, they could not endure it.</p>
            <pb n="65" facs="tcp:18031:37"/>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly another tryall is, at whoſe ſinnes we grieue moſt. An hypocrite is the ſoreſt and buſieſt digger of all, but it is in other mens ground; but he that would haue a good foundation, muſt be moſt induſtrious in purging his owne ſoule from iniquity. That was a complaint that <hi>Ieremie</hi> made,<note place="margin">Ier. 8. 6.</note> that no man ſaid, <hi>What haue I done?</hi> but all the ſtirre of hypocrites is, what others haue done. Whereas if we could come to this, I haue liued in this ſinne, I haue broken promiſe, I haue bene vnfaithfull in Gods ſeruice: what way may I take to get peace vnto my ſoule?</p>
            <p>This were the way indeed to get a ſound heart: and this is a good argument of a ſound heart, when the ſinnes of our owne ſoules do more vexe vs, than all the iniuries that men haue done, or can do againſt vs, and therefore we are euer buſie in ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching out the hidden corruptions that lye lurking within our ſoules, that ſo our foundation may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ſtill vnmoueable: for this is the difference betwixt an earthly houſe and a ſpirituall, that the one needeth but once to haue a ſure foundation laid, but the other requireth daily looking to. There is ſome one corruption or other that muſt be caſt forth: ſo that Chriſtians are ſearching and digging builders: who albeit they ſeeme to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be very blinde, yet they get the greateſt meaſure of knowledge: and though they be very dead in their owne feeling, yet they carry away the life of God and the life of grace.</p>

               </label> They are the bleſſedeſt hearers of the word, that are the beſt practiſers of the ſame. Therefore is it that Chriſt Ieſus pronounceth ſuch <hi>bleſſed, as heare the word, and do it. Luke</hi> 11. 28. Yea more bleſſed than the virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was for bearing Chriſt in her wombe; for that alone could not haue ſaued her: whereas the word of God heard and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, is ſufficient to bring the ſoule to euerlaſting life: and not ſo alone, but it alſo giues the parties right vnto, and the enioyment of all manner of outward bleſſings whatſoeuer, as is ſhewed at large, <hi>Deut. 28. Leuit.</hi> 26. The reaſons why ſuch are bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, are theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, becauſe they ſhall be able to ſtand it out in all manner of temptations, ſo that though all the diuels in hell were turned looſe vpon them, they ſhould bee more then conquerours ouer them all.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, this maketh for the increaſing of their happineſſe, that they ſhall ſtill grow in knowledge. For our Sauiour ſaith: <hi>If any one will do his wil, he ſhal</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn. 7. 17</note> 
               <hi>know of the doctrine, whether it be of God or no.</hi> You ſhall haue many, who before the receiuing of the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:18031:38"/> Sacrament, and at ſuch like times, will deale with their Miniſter, that he would not examine them; for they are not booke learned: and beſides, they are old, and their memories will not ſerue them. And will you know the true reaſon hereof? it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen that of our Sauiour: <hi>They will not do the will of God, and therefore they know it not.</hi> For their capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities and memories, and all the faculties of their ſoules and bodies will ſerue them well enough for their couetouſneſſe, for craftie and ſubtill dealing, and for ſuch pleaſures as they are addicted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, this practiſing of the word will be a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of an honeſt heart: for that is the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of it, to heare and receiue, to vnderſtand and hold faſt the word, and to bring forth fruite with patience. Many doubt that they haue vnſound hearts; let them bring themſelues to this touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone: Do they grow to ſome fruitfulneſſe in good workes by the hearing of the word, and are they not diſcouraged though ſome heat of affliction do ariſe? then our Sauiour teſtifieth that they haue good and honeſt hearts. So long as one deſires to do his duty, and from his deſire is drawen to prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and by prayer gets vertue from Chriſt, whereby the commandements are made eaſie, ſo long he needeth not to feare his eſtate, for it is good and comfortable.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, here is a ſingular conſolation for thoſe that deſire in their hearts to do the whole will of God; then they do it in Gods account: for with him we are reputed as we are affected: if one giue but two mites, as the poore widow did, with a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and chearefull heart, it ſhall be accepted and commended; yea though it be but a cup of cold water, it ſhall not go vnrewarded. A father doth not reſpect ſo much how exactly his child doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, as how obediently he performes it: and though he cannot doe as he would, if he weepe, and deſire his father to helpe him to doe better, it ſufficiently contenteth a parents minde; ſo if we be ready and deſirous to do euery thing that is commanded, and to beleeue euery thing that is promiſed, and to auoyde euery euill that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; Chriſt hath ſaid it, and we ſhall finde it one day, whatſoeuer we feele now, that we are bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and happy people, members of the Sonne of God, temples of the holy Ghoſt, and the ſonnes &amp; daughters of the euerliuing God. Our Sauiour ſaith vnto his diſciples, <hi>VVithout me ye can do nothing.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 15. 5.</note> Doe we then ſomething in truth of heart? then we are in Chriſt branches of the true vine, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth fruit in him, we ſhall be ſtill purged to bring forth greater abundance thereof.</p>
            <pb n="69" facs="tcp:18031:39"/>
            <p>[<hi>And when the waters aroſe, the floud beate vpon that houſe, and could not ſhake it.</hi>] In that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth the goodneſſe of this building, becauſe it ſtood when the ſtormes did beat vpon it, the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is. that</p>

A wiſe builder is wiſe before ſtormes ariſe, though he be not put to it: but how ſhall that be knowne? by the ſtanding of his houſe in extremitie of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. If in the midſt of all tryals he hold his owne and ſtand it out, and proue the ſame man ſtill, then is his wiſedome apparant to all: he that builds on the ſand hath (it may be) as faire and goodly a houſe in ſhew as the other; but when the winds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, it quickely tumbles downe. And ſo it is with hypocrites, if troubles be approching to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, eſpecially if they once beginne to pinch them, they are gone: one puffe of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; one ſhew of promotion; one ſtorme of affliction, makes all their building in matters of religion to become altogether ruinous.</p>
            <p>So for the grounds, what could the good ground ſay for it ſelfe for a time, which the ill grounds could not? They were all plowed, they all receiued the ſeede, and brought it aboue ground thoſe that did leaſt. Whence was the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference then? The bad grounds had not the ſtones digged out, nor the thornes grubbed vp; and therefore the ſeede ſpringing vp in the one ſort, when the parching heat came, withered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:18031:40"/> and that in the other was choaked by the thornes, and ſo came to nought: each of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> failing when their tryall came: whereas the good ground held out vnto the end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peter</hi> was a good houſe, <hi>Iudas</hi> was an ill houſe; therefore when a ſtorme came, though <hi>Peter</hi> loſt a ſlatte or two, as the beſt houſe may, yet the foundation and the ſide-wals ſtood firme: he wept bitterly for his ſinne, and craued pardon for it, and ſo all was repaired. But what of <hi>Iudas?</hi> he ſtood indifferently well for a while: but at length when Chriſt rebuked him, he was full of wrath; and when the high Prieſts offered him money, he was full of couetouſneſſe: and ſo thinking to gaine more by ſelling of Chriſt, than by ſeruing of him, hee quite forſooke his Maiſter, and ſought how to betray him to his moſt mortall aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Ioſeph</hi> being good vnder his fathers gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, continued good alſo vnder the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Infidels, where he had all meanes of damnation, but none of ſaluation; yea though he were at firſt in an vnchaſt houſe, where he was ſet vpon by his vnchaſt miſtres; and afterwards caſt in priſon amongſt the notableſt malefactors in all the country: yet looke what manner of man <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was in his fathers houſe, the ſame he was ſtill, both in <hi>Potiphars</hi> houſe, and in the priſon; and the ſame he continued to be when he came to great aduancement in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> court, which was the moſt dangerous temptation of all the reſt.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:18031:40"/> Hereunto we may adde, that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was a young man, and therefore more likely to be caried away; but all was nothing: when his heart was ſound, all the powers of hell could not preuaile againſt him.</p>
            <p>On the contrary part, it is ſaid of <hi>Amaziah,</hi> that<note place="margin">2 Chron. 25. 5.</note> he <hi>did that which was vpright in the eyes of the Lord, but not with a perfect heart.</hi> Therefore marke what came of it: after that he had ouercome the <hi>Edomites,</hi> his heart was lifted vp, and he (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to common ſenſe) fell to worſhip their Idols, whom he had vanquiſhed in battle: he would not bee ſo preciſe any longer, nor be at the command of euery Prophet, but would take his liberty: and ſo being an hypocrite in the beginning, he manifeſted himſelfe to be a miſerable hypocrite in the end. So <hi>Ioaſh</hi> all the while the good Prieſt<note place="margin">2 Chron. 24.</note> 
               <hi>Iehoiadah</hi> liued, that would not ſuffer him to take ill courſes, was very forward, yea in ſome things more forward then <hi>Iehoiadah</hi> himſelfe: but as<note place="margin">2 Kings 12. 7.</note> ſoone as <hi>Iehoiadah</hi> was dead, his religion was dead with him, and of a profeſſour, he became a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutour; and nothing could ſtay him from his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked courſes, vntill he was taken away by a violent death.</p>
            <p>But that the point may be yet more cleare, we wil giue inſtance in ſome particular things, wherein men iudge themſelues to be very ſtrong, when as the truth is they are exceeding weake.</p>
            <p>Many will thanke God, that though in other things they come ſhort, yet they are endued with
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:18031:41"/> patience: but what doe they when wrongs are offered them? why then they take on as bad as the worſt. Such neede not brag of the aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of their patience, for they haue neuer a iot more then they finde when iniures are offered them.</p>
            <p>So others there are, that hope they loue the truth: but let one of the Family of loue, or of the Browniſts ſet vpon them, and what will they doe? preſently beginne to thinke, and ſpeake hardly of the ſeruantes and ſeruices of God, and of the truth of God. This plainely argueth that there was in the heart but little loue of the truth, but much proneneſſe &amp; aptneſſe vnto errours and hereſies. He is the truely couragious ſouldier that wil ſtand to it, when the skirmiſh is at hotteſt: as for thoſe that will bragge much before, and betake them to their heeles, or ioyne (for feare) with the aduerſarie when the battle beginnes, they are meere cowards, vtterly vnworthy of the name of ſouldiers.</p>
            <p>Againe, others are conceited that they haue merciful hearts; but hereby they manifeſt the quite contrary, that they giue ſo little of their ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity to thoſe that are in neceſſity, whoſe hearts might be gladded, and whoſe ſoules might be ſtirred vp to offer praiſes and prayers vnto the Lord for them, in regard of their liberality.</p>
            <p>Others againe will not be perſwaded, but they make conſcience of the Sabboth: but if there be occaſion of trauell offered on that day, will they
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:18031:41"/> not rather God ſhould loſe his glory, than they their commodity? Yes ſurely, and thereby they ſhew themſelues to be but prophane perſons, that did neuer conſcionably ſanctify the Sabboth: for if they had done ſo, euery ſleight temptation would neuer carry them ſo farre wide.</p>

But how was he affected when danger was neare?

            <p>[<hi>Becauſe God is in the generation of the iuſt.</hi>] This is one reaſon why it muſt needs go hardly with wicked men, that are deuourers and ſpoilers of Gods people; becauſe the Lord himſelfe is among them, to take notice of all the iniuries and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities which they ſuſtaine, and to reuenge their

            <p>Yea further (which is of all other things moſt ſtrange) the poore lambes of Chriſt are ſo far from being torne in pieces by thoſe Lyons, that they become Lyons themſelues, not for cruelty but for courage. For ſo ſaith the Prophet <hi>Micah: And the</hi>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Concerning themſelues, firſt they are neuer able to meditate on the word. For whatſoeuer a man comes vnwillingly to hearken vnto, that will quickly ſlip out of his minde, neither can hee poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly get it to take any deepe roote in his heart. Hence is it that when couetous, or malicious, or vnchaſt perſons repaire vnto Sermons to pleaſe their maſters, or to ſatisfie the law, or for ſome ſuch by-reſpect, they neuer ſeriouſly think of that which they haue heard, to make any application thereof vnto themſelues; they cannot bring their hearts vnto it: for a ſinfull conſcience will not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to be tied to the word of the Lord.

He that is vnwilling to heare his dutie, will be much more vnwilling to doe it. If wee ſee a ſeruant that cannot endure to bee informed what is his maſters will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, we preſently conclude that ſuch an one will not prooue a faithfull and truſtie ſeruant: and ſo may we do without any breach of charitie, when wee perceiue a man to be altogether careleſſe, or contemptuous in liſtening to the charge of his heauenly maſter: hee that cannot abide to heare of the duties of the Sabbath, nor of the exerciſes of religion that hee is to performe in his familie, and the like, we may boldly ſay, except the Lord conuert this mans heart, certainly hee will neuer make conſcience of performing theſe duties.</p>

And becauſe they will bee very loath to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge thus much, but are readie to harbour too good an opinion of themſelues, as if none were more forward hearers then they are, let their owne hearts bee iudges, what preparation they make before hand for the fitting of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues for ſuch a great work; what attention they vſe when they are preſent, and what meditation and conference they haue concerning it when they are departed. Of which points if they would without partialitie examine themſelues, they ſhould eaſily diſcerne a great deale of back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe in their nature and in their practiſe. If a man ſhould proteſt that hee goes to the market with a great deſire to buy food for himſelfe and his family, yet if hee alwaies plaied the vnthrift with his money, and neuer brought home any prouiſion, we would not giue credit to his words, but account him a meere diſſembler: and the like cenſure may we paſſe on ſuch, as pretend they are willing to reape benefit by the word, to the intent they may bee able to helpe both themſelues and their families, and yet neuer carrie away any thing to the purpoſe, but if you aske them what points were handled, they can ſay nothing, but this, ſurely wee heard a very good Sermon, God be thanked, but my memorie is very ſhort, or I cannot vtter all that I haue in my minde: my heart, I hope, is as good as the beſt, though I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:18031:71"/> talke of the Sermon as others doe: what is this but to deceiue their owne ſoules with vaine words? for certainly he that hath a heart willing to heare, will haue a tongue readie to vtter, in ſome tolerable ſort, that which hee hath heard, though not all of it, yet a good part of it, as God hath giuen to euery one the meaſure of grace.</p>
            <p>Another ſort are here to be reproued, who doe in a more palpable and groſſe manner manifeſt their vnwillingnes to heare, in that they will take euery ſlight occaſion to abſent themſelues, and that not onely on the weeke daies, but on the Lords day alſo: ſo that when the Lord commeth euen to their dores, and offereth to powre down his graces abundantly vpon them, they refuſe his gratious offer, and ſo <hi>iudge themſelues vnworthie of</hi>

               <p>This we may ſee euidently in ſundry examples
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:18031:73"/> of Scripture, as firſt of all in thoſe of whom men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made in the Reuelation, where it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Reuel. 11.</note> that there were two witneſſes, that is, a competent and ſufficient number of faithfull preachers, which were like <hi>Oliue trees,</hi> to diſtill the oyle of <note place="margin">verſe 4.</note> grace into mens hearts, and like <hi>Candleſticks</hi> to hold forth the light vnto thoſe that liued in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ignorance: but what was the effect of their preaching?

                  <hi>vexed them that dwelt on the earth:</hi> that is, all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minded men: all ſuch as were ignorant and proud, vnchaſt and couetous: ſo that they could neuer bee well, till they had killed them, and caſt out their corpſes into the ſtreetes of the citie: but then they were glad and reioyced, and ſent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents one to another in token of their ioy, hoping that now theſe two witneſſes were diſpatched out of the way, they ſhould go on merily in their leaud courſes, and liue at hearts eaſe.</p>

               <p>The like may be ſeene in <hi>Paul,</hi> who for deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the holy and powerfull doctrine of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, was counted a peſtilent fellow, and a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler<note place="margin">Acts 24.</note> of the whole world: not of the Saints that were in the world, but of ſuch as were men of the world, who could not endure to haue their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, their Idolatrie, their hypocriſie, the ill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of their tongues, of their affections and of their families, laid open and diſgraced, and the reformation of theſe corruptions vrged and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vpon their conſciences.

                  </label> Herein ſtandeth the difference, that the godlie take notice of the corruptions of their nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile them, and labor to ſuppreſſe them, not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling the luſts of their fleſh, either for the omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of holy duties, or the practiſe of any manner of euill: for they haue the ſpirit in them which<note place="margin">Galath. 5.</note> doth alwaies reſiſt the ſinfull motions of the fleſh, ſo that as they cannot doe the good which they would, becauſe the fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit, that is, againſt the regenerate part in them: ſo neither can they do the euill that ſometimes they would, becauſe the ſpirit ſtrugleth and fighteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the luſts of the fleſh.

               </p>
               <p>From which words it is apparent, that it is an admirable and ſupernaturall worke to haue a well diſpoſed minde, and a well affected heart vnto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that concernes the worſhip of God and his glorie: to be franke and free-hearted in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing ones ſubſtance vpon ſumptuous buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, coſtly apparel, great houſe-keeping, ſetting vp Lords of miſrule, and the like, is a thing not worth the ſpeaking of, becauſe a mecre carnall man in arrogancie and vain-glorie may bee very lauiſh and prodigall to ſuch ends and purpoſes.

               <p>Firſt of all, if there bee nothing in a man but that which by nature and induſtrie may be attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> vnto, then ſurely hee hath not in him the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God; for that is aboue nature, and worketh ſupernaturall effects: in which regard the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle doth ſet the ſpirit of God in oppoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt the ſpirit of the world, ſaying, <hi>Wee haue receiued the ſpirit, not of the world, but of God.</hi> 1.

               <p>Secondly, conſider whether there be in thee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> any alteration, and change: for in regeneration, there muſt be a corruption of ſin, ſo that as ſeed in the ground, ſo ſin in our ſoules, may decay, that the new man may bee raiſed vp, the ſpirit of God taking poſſeſſion of our ſoules.

                  <note place="margin">Iuſtification.</note> The third note and effect is, the bringing on forward of this work vnto iuſtification: for when the ſpirit hath brought vs thus farre, then doth it begin to open vnto vs a doore vnto the grace and fauour of God. It doth put into our mindes that there is mercie with God, and therefore ſtirreth vs vp to ſeeke mercie at his hands: afterward it doth let vs ſee how Chriſt ſuffered to take away the ſinnes of the world, that in the righteouſnes of Chriſt, wee may looke to bee iuſtified before God. And this it doth not let vs ſee only, but doth effectuallie worke a ſure perſwaſion of it in our
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:18031:88"/> hearts, and confirmeth the ſame by two notable <note place="margin">Effects of iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</note> effects.</p>
               <p>The firſt is a ioy moſt vnſpeakeable and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,<note place="margin">1. Ioy. 1. <hi>Pet. 1. 8. Rom. 5. 2.</hi>
                  </note> wherewith our hearts muſt needs be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken vp, and rauiſhed, when we ſee our ſelues by the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, of the free mercy and grace of God, redeemed from death, deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from hell, and freed from the fearefull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the wicked.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is the peace of conſcience, which<note place="margin">2. Peace. <hi>Rom. 5. 1. Philip. 4. 6.</hi>
                  </note> indeed paſſeth all vnderſtanding. While ſin, and the guilt of ſinne remained, there was no peace, nor reſt, nor quietnes to be found, but feare with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, terrors without, and troubles on euery ſide: but when once ſinne is nailed to the croſſe of Chriſt: when the guilt thereof is taken out of our conſciences, and the puniſhment thereof far remoued, then muſt needs enſue great peace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God is at one with vs: and for this we haue the warrant and teſtimonie of the ſpirit: for fleſh and blood cannot worke in vs this holy and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly aſſurance.</p>
               <p>And hereof doth ariſe a fourth note, to wit, the<note place="margin">4. Readineſſe to doe good.</note> life and nimblenes that is in vs to doe good: for when a man doth finde fauour from God, for the forgiuenes of his ſins, then the loue of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraineth him, and that ioy which hee conceiueth inforceth him and putteth life into him for the performance of thoſe things, which are pleaſing vnto God. Then he beginneth to finde himſelf, not only reclaimed from euill, but alſo framed to
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:18031:88"/> that which is good. Then is his vnderſtanding inlightened to ſee into the myſteries of godlines, then is his iudgement reformed, ſo that he is able to diſcerne betwixt truth and falſehood, betwixt that which is good and that which is euill. Then are his affections in ſome good meaſure altered:<note place="margin">1. Theſſ. 5. 23.</note> his deſire is ſet, not vpon earthly, but vpon hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie things: his ioyes are not in earth but in heauen: his anger is waſted and ſpent, not vpon his owne priuate cauſe and quarrels, but his owne ſinnes, and vpon whatſoeuer hindreth the glorie of his God. This is the life of God in him: thus<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 18. Rom 8 2.</note> he liueth that hath receiued the ſpirit, and thus he leadeth his life continually: for they that haue receiued the ſpirit, are led by the ſpirit, and doe liue accordingly, bringing foorth the fruits of the<note place="margin">Galath. 5. 22.</note> ſpirit.</p>
               <p>But this hath frailtie ioyned with it, and men through weakeneſſe may ſoone fall: therefore if notwithſtanding that, we will know whether we ſtill retaine the ſpirit, wee muſt trie our ſelues by theſe rules:</p>
               <p>Firſt, if through infirmitie wee haue fallen, (as who doth not) and will know whether thereby<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iames</hi> 3. 1. Notes of the ſpirit after ſlips. 1. Hatred of ſinne.</note> we haue loſt the ſpirit of God, or no, let vs exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what liking or miſliking we haue of ſinne: for if we ſtill hold our former hatred of that, and the oftner we fall, the more thorough and deadly hatred we conceiue againſt it, vndoubtedly that frailtie hath not as yet depriued vs of the ſpirit; for this holy deteſtatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſin is a fruit of the ſpirit.</p>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:18031:89"/>
               <p>Secondly, conſider how it ſtandeth with thy<note place="margin">2. Sorrow for ſinne. 2. <hi>Cor. 7.</hi>
                  </note> ſorrow: for ſo long as thy ſorrow for ſin increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, it cannot bee, that the ſpirit ſhould bee quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in thee.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, trie thy care, and if thou finde thy ſelf<note place="margin">3 Care to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid it.</note> more carefull both to fight againſt ſinne and to preuent it, by auoiding the occaſions of it, then know that, not it, but grace hath dominion in thy<note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> heart.</p>
               <p>But the laſt is moſt certaine, and that is this,<note place="margin">4. Greater zeale in well doing. 2. <hi>Cor. 7. 11. Epheſ. 4.</hi>
                  </note> when thou art carefull to redeeme that, which by thy fall thou haſt loſt, and haſt a care to runne ſo much faſter forward, by how much more thou haſt been letted by thy fall: then it doth appeare that the ſpirit is in thee, yea it is liuely and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in operation, and ſuch as ſhall neuer bee taken from thee, vntill the day of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now further, when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Quench not the ſpirit,</hi> hee implieth that the ſpirit is in ſome reſpects like vnto fire; therefore if wee doe but a little conſider of the nature of fire, we ſhall a great deale better iudge of the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, it will conſume things that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible:<note place="margin">1. The properties of the Spirit whereby it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembleth fire. <hi>Rom. 8. 13.</hi>
                  </note> and therefore lighting vpon ſtraw, ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, &amp;c. it bringeth all to aſhes: ſo doth the ſpirit in our ſoules waſt, and at length bring to nothing all noiſome luſts whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, fire doth purge and purifie things: and ſo doth the ſpirit purge vs from the droſſe of<note place="margin">Ioh. 15. 2. Acts 15. 9.</note> ſinne daily more and more, that we may be holie temples for him to dwell in.</p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:18031:89"/>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, fire giueth light euen in the darkeſt places: and ſo is the ſpirit a ſhining lampe, euer<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 1. 5. 6.</note> giuing light vnto vs in the midſt of the darknes of this world.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> And laſt of all, fire giueth heate, and withall doth as it were put life into thoſe things which are capable of life: for whileſt a man is frozen and ſtarued, he is numbde, and as it were without life: but being brought to the fire, hee is reuiued, and cheered, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> becommeth actiue and nimble: euen ſo doth the Spirit ſet vs on heate, and infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth<note place="margin">Coloſſ. 2 13. Epheſ. 2. 1.</note> vs with a zeale of Gods glorie, with a care of our dutie, and with a loue of all mankinde; yea withall it putteth life into vs to walk in that good way which leadeth vnto life.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee what likelihood there is between the ſpirit and fire, for which cauſe it is ſometimes called fire: as Matth. 3. 11. Therefore as truly and certainly as we may ſay there is fire where we ſee ſtraw or ſtickes conſumed, gold or ſiluer purged, great light in dark places, or great heate and liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines in bodies that were benummed before: ſo truly may wee ſay, and ſo certainly may wee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade our ſelues that the ſpirit of God is in vs, when wee ſee our corruptions conſumed, our ſoules purged, our hearts inlightened, and made hot in walking, and working according to that light.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2. Queſtion."/> The ſecond queſtion to be conſidered is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that man which hath once truly taſted of the ſpirit, may loſe it, and haue it quenched in him?</p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> There is a ſecond kinde of working of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which is more effectuall, which can neuer bee loſt.

               <p>Some experience of this wee may ſee among vs: Courtiers will be profeſſors, and Schollers of ripe wits will be religious, if that Courtiers may
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:18031:92"/> become Counſellors, and Schollers may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the chiefeſt places: but if promotion come not, then is their profeſſion forſaken, and their religion laid aſide: and yet that is not all, for either they waxe prophane in their liues, or here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall in their opinions. Doe the children of God loue on this manner? No, the holy Ghoſt which they haue receiued in effectuall manner, doth ſhed the ſeede of loue in their hearts, and doth<note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> worke in them a ſpeciall liking of his goodneſſe and of his holineſſe, ſo that they loue him not for<note place="margin">Pſal. 116. 1.</note> his bleſſings alone, but chiefly for himſelfe: as the naturall childe loueth his father naturally, and though his father beate him, yet he beareth it, and ſtill loueth him. They haue powred and infuſed<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1. 2. 3. 4.</note> into them a godly nature, ſo that they doe freelie loue God their father: and though he afflict the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or croſſe them in their deſires, yet they loue him, and in loue performe their obedience vnto him continually. Therefore <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith, <hi>Though hee kill</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iob 13.</note> 
                  <hi>me, yet will I truſt in him.</hi> And this is the third mark or rule whereby to proue and trie ourſelues.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The laſt rule is in conſidering the effect of Gods mercies receiued. For herein doe the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſhew their wickednes two waies.</p>
               <p>Firſt on the right hand, the mercies of God do worke in them a wonderfull contentation, but not ſuch as cauſeth them to returne the glory vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, but rather to aſcribe it vnto themſelues: for the graces of God doe puffe them vp, &amp; make them conceited in themſelues. Hereof there ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:18031:92"/> a great ſecuritie, which bringeth firſt neglect, and after contempt of all good meanes. On the left hand others offend, being neuer pleaſed nor contented with that they haue: nay indeed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting, or lightly eſteeming that they haue, and ſtill deſiring new. Theſe men beſides that they are vnthankful, they doe alſo murmure &amp; grudge againſt God, and are neuer pleaſed with him. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene theſe two doe the children of God hold a middle and euen courſe, and therefore we ſhall ſee theſe things in them. Firſt a ſight and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of their wants, which cauſe them. to long for the <hi>ſincere milke of the word,</hi> that thereby their wants may be ſupplied and their graces in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed: and ſo farre are they from being lifted vp with pride, that they reioyce when their pride may be pulled downe, whether by rebukes, or threatnings, or corrections from the Lord. For they know that if <hi>Paul</hi> needed meanes of hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, (2. Cor. 12.) much more doe they.</p>
               <p>Beſides, as they deſire the word, ſo they waite vntill it pleaſe the Lord to worke further in them thereby: and this waiting is as earneſt as theirs, who hauing watched all night, do waite and look for the dawning of the day.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as they ſee their wants, ſo doe they<note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 10.</note> alſo ſee the graces they haue receiued, and are for that time well apaid and contented therewith: and therefore as their wants doe humble them, ſo Gods graces doe comfort them: and as their wants do call vpon them to ſeek more, ſo the gifts
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:18031:93"/> they haue prouoke them to bee thankfull for that they haue receiued. And thus much for the laſt rule of trial. Theſe forenamed properties whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer can finde in himſelf, he may bee aſſured that the ſpirit hath wrought in him ſo effectually, as that it ſhall neuer be taken from him.</p>
               <p>But what then? may ſuch caſt off all care? No, the Apoſtle ſaith vnto ſuch, <hi>Quench not the ſpirit.</hi> And not without cauſe: for though the ſpirit it ſelfe can neuer be vtterly taken from them, yet doubtleſſe if pride, ſecurity, or any other ſinne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to take place in them, the graces of the ſpirit may decay, and their cleere vnderſtanding, and comfortable feelings may be gone, ſo that in their own and others iudgements, the ſpirit may ſeem to be quite extinguiſhed.</p>
               <p>Neither muſt this ſeeme ſtrange: for if the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God which was more perfectly placed in <hi>Adam,</hi> might bee quite loſt, then no maruell if the graces of the ſpirit bee drowned in vs for a time. The Galathians were truly regenerated, and had receiued Chriſt into their hearts: yet their graces were ſo choked and quenched, that hee was as it were without faſhion or forme: ſo<note place="margin">Galath. 4. 19.</note> that the Apoſtle did as it were trauell againe, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till Chriſt was faſhioned anew in them. <hi>Dauid</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo vpon the committing of his ſinne was brought vnto that caſe, that he praied God to <hi>create in him</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 51.</note> 
                  <hi>a new ſpirit.</hi> What, was the ſpirit quite gone? No, for by and by after he praieth that God <hi>would not take his holy ſpirit from him:</hi> but the graces thereof
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:18031:93"/> were wonderfully decaied, and therefore he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that they might be renued.</p>
               <p>But that none may abuſe this doctrine, let vs conſider what puniſhments doe follow vpon the<note place="margin">Euils that follow vpon quenching of the ſpirit.</note> quenching of the ſpirit in this ſort.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt of all wee muſt know, that though the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit be not gotten by our labour, yet that is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the obtaining of it, and it muſt coſt vs much paines ere we can get it into our hearts: all which ſeemeth to be loſt when the graces of the ſpirit are withered.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, all that peace and ioy, before ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, is gone, with how great griefe and woe they know that in any meaſure haue taſted of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, for that time they haue no heart to do good, but are made vnprofitable burde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Moreouer, ſuch are in danger of falling into reprochfull euils, and ſo to procure the ſharp cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting hand of God vpon themſelues, who hath ſaid, that <hi>though hee will not take his mercies vtterlie from</hi> his children, yet <hi>hee will viſite their ſinnes with the rod, and their iniquities with ſcourges:</hi> as he dealt with <hi>Dauid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Laſt of all, when the graces of the ſpirit of God are once decaied, they cannot bee repaired but with very much ſorrow: for what a griefe will it be to call to minde our former tranſgreſſions; to aggrauate them by all circumſtances, to apply the terrible threatnings of the law to our ſtonie harts, and the like? The conſideration of all which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities, ſhould cauſe vs to beware how we quench the ſpirit.</p>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:18031:94"/>
               <p>Yet here is matter of comfort alſo: for though wee may ſuffer a great decay of Gods graces, yet by the rod or by the word, or by both, they ſhall be renued in vs againe.</p>

               <head>Of murmuring in the time of affliction.</head>
               <p>MAny men hearing of the often murmurings of the Iſraelites, doe iudge them the worſt people vnder the Sunne: but ſuch doe little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, either the temptations whereby they were prouoked to murmure, or the corruption of their owne hearts, which will as bitterly murmure vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on leſſe occaſion. For albeit they were an obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and ſtiffe-necked people, yet herein they were vehemently tempted, that they came from plenty in Egypt, to ſcarſitie in the wilderneſſe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing neither meate nor drinke for all that multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, being ſixe hundred thouſand men, beſides women and children. Wherefore let vs ceaſe to wonder at this people, and in them ſee our owne corruption. For doe not many amongſt vs, behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the abundance which the Lord hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon Magiſtrates or Miniſters for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their duties, doe they not (I ſay) rather murmure at it, then ſhew themſelues thankfull for troubles that they are freed from, and for ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie that the Lord hath giuen them to liue vpon?</p>
               <p>True it is, that notwithſtanding the greatnes of this peoples temptation, their ſinne was very hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous; for Gods mercies had been wonderfull to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:18031:94"/> them euen immediatly before, and that the vnthankfulleſt of them had been driuen to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe: yet did they wiſh to returne to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer<note place="margin">Pſal. 106.</note> bondage, rather then to bee brought to ſuch ſtraits: but notwithſtanding the grieuouſnes of this their ſinne, many now adaies come nothing behinde them: for their eyes are ſo vpon their wants, that the want of one thing which they do deſire, though it be but ſmall, doth more diſquiet them, then manifold bleſſings doe comfort them, to make them thankfull.</p>
               <p>But this diſcontentment wee muſt be armed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt: which we ſhall be, if wee can receiue the fauour of God for it ſelfe, though it come alone, yea though trouble doe come therewith: for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it, wee haue all things, and wanting it, wee haue nothing. Againe, if wee haue it, no miſerie can make vs miſerable: and if wee haue it not, in greateſt proſperitie we are moſt miſerable.</p>
               <p>But the Iſraelites here dealt after a cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie manner: for the want of bread in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, being but for their bodies, did make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to deſpiſe their great and wonderfull deliuerance out of Egypt, which was vnto them a ſigne of their ſpirituall deliuerance. And this is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all worldlings; they had rather forgo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſpirituall benefits, then one corporall commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie: they grieue more at the loſing, and reioyce more at the hauing of wealth, then of godlineſſe.</p>
               <p>But to returne to the point in hand, ſith mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring is ſo great a ſinne, it ſhall be profitable to conſider of ſome remedies againſt it.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Now for as much as impatiencie proceedeth from infidelitie, the remedie thereof muſt bee fetched from faith in Gods mercies, in the merits of Chriſt, in the hope of the reſurrection, and in Gods fatherly prouidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt (I ſay) Gods rich mercie and fauourable dealing with vs, being duly conſidered, cannot but worke in vs patience: for ſeeing that the Lord forbeareth vs, and that when for the ripenes of our ſinnes he might confound vs, he doth rather heape bleſſings vpon vs, this cannot but bridle vs from murmuring, though all things fall not out according to our hearts deſire. Eſpecially ſeeing that the Lord will deale with vs ſtill as hee did with the Iſraelites, that when ordinarie meanes failed, had extraordinary prouiſion made for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; the cloudes giuing them bread, and the rock wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to teach vs that man liueth not by bread only (as <hi>Moſes</hi> applieth it, Deut. 8.) but by the word of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> A ſecond remedie is, to haue a liuely faith in the worke of our redemption, to wit, the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our ſinnes, the imputation of Chriſt his righteouſnes, and inherent ſanctification.</p>
               <p>Firſt then if we can ſtedfaſtly beleeue that God for Chriſt his ſake hath freely forgiuen vs all our ſinnes, and giuen his ſonne, that in him we might be bleſſed, we cannot but be aſſured, that <hi>with him</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>he will giue vs all things.</hi> For ſeeing ſin, which is the cauſe of all miſerie, is taken from vs, wee may bee ſure that no croſſe ſhall euer hurt vs.</p>
               <p>Againe, if wee could beleeue that as God doth
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:18031:95"/> lay our ſins vpon Chriſt, ſo he doth impute his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes to vs, how ſhould we doubt of food or rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp;c? For by this meanes he is made our mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull and louing father, who is for power, able, and for will, readie to helpe vs in all extremities. And thus doth he abide for euer, and is neuer changed.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> To theſe two former, muſt bee added the ſecond part of our redemption, namely, the ſanctification of the ſpirit, which if we feele in our ſelues, may bee a great helpe vnto vs againſt impatiencie: for it is a greater thing to ſanctifie a ſinner, then to worke wonders in nature. Therefore if we can beleeue in our hearts that God is able to make of ſinfull and wicked men, iuſt and righteous, of whoremongers, chaſt perſons, &amp;c. and that he is able and willing to deliuer vs from all our corruptions, be they neuer ſo ſtrong by nature or cuſtome; if, I ſay, we can giue credit vnto this, why ſhould we euer doubt that he will faile vs in outward things?</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Further, if we can beleeue that God hath prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a kingdome for vs, and that he will raiſe vs vp at the laſt day in body and ſoule to enioy the ſame; how can we but be aſſured that he will giue vs leſſer matters, euen the things of this life?</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Another thing to ſtay our hearts vpon when murmuring doth aſſaile vs, is faith in Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; which is either generall or particular.</p>
               <p>The generall prouidence of God muſt be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, firſt in the creation of all things: ſecondly in the preſeruation of them.</p>
               <p>Doe wee then beleeue that the Lord made all things of nothing, and ſhall we doubt of his abilitie
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:18031:96"/> to prouide for vs? When God created light before the Sun, the Moone, or the Stars: and cauſed graſſe<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 3.</note> to grow vpon the earth, before there was either raine or dew to water it, hee did thereby teach vs: firſt, that we ſhould not put too much truſt in them whileſt we haue them: and againe, that rather then we ſhould ſuffer hurt by the want of light, graſſe, or other ſuch things, the Lord both could and would prouide for vs without them. Yet now if we ſhould not haue the Sun, wee would think that light were taken from vs: and if we wanted raine, wee would ſoone thinke wee ſhould neither haue graſſe, nor corne: but the Lord hath ordained theſe meanes to ſerue his prouidence, not for himſelfe, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them he can eaſily help vs, but for our weaknes, who otherwiſe could not eaſily bee aſſured of his goodneſſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we muſt beleeue that God preſerueth all: ſo that a ſparrow doth not fall to the ground<note place="margin">Matth. 10.</note> without his prouidence, and he hath a great care of beaſts, and fowles: doth the Lord prouide for theſe,<note place="margin">Matth. 6.</note> and will hee not prouide for man, for whom theſe were made, and are preſerued? Hereunto we muſt ioyne the particular prouidence of God: Hath he made our bodies, and will he not clothe vs? hath he giuen vs life, and will he not miniſter vnto vs foode for the ſuſtaining thereof? Hee could prouide for the Iſraelites in the barren wilderneſſe fortie yeeres together: yea hee could preſerue <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> fortie daies without any meate at all: which eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently proueth that Gods bleſſing is all in all, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be meanes or no meanes.</p>
